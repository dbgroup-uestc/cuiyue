  Long time no sign in (so long as to forgot password:) ). It is exciting to find this project got two stars! Thank you so much. These are the very first starts I've got. Also many thanks to Liu et al.! It is them who have done these great intensive evaluation works (especially codes) and I'm only a porter. \
  Besides continue updating 12 papers, I am going to follow up with state-of-art works on recommendation systems, which will be presented in the new archive named "RecSys 2018-" More detailed discussion is also documented there.\

  5.Location recommendation in location-based social networks using user check-in data \
  PDF:  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manolis_Terrovitis/publication/260294299_Location_Recommendation_in_Location-based_Social_Networks_using_User_Check-in_Data/links/0f317530ac8b50c7bc000000.pdf \
  code: http://spatialkeyword.sce.ntu.edu.sg/eval-vldb17/code/LFBCA.zip \
  data: is the same as 1.
  
 6.Lore: Exploiting sequential influence for location recommendations \
  PDF:   http://users.wpi.edu/~yli15/Includes/SIGSPATIAL2014_lore.pdf  \
  code: http://spatialkeyword.sce.ntu.edu.sg/eval-vldb17/code/LORE.zip \
  data: is the same as 1.
 
 
 7. Exploiting geographical neighborhood characteristics for location recommendation \
  PDF:http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4772&context=sis_research \
  code: http://spatialkeyword.sce.ntu.edu.sg/eval-vldb17/code/IRenMF.zip \
  data: is the same as 1.
  
  
 8.Geomf: Joint geographical modeling and matrix factorization for point-of-interest recommendation \
  PDF:  http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/paper_pdf/2014/Defu-Lian-KDD.pdf \

 *9.Rank-geofm: A ranking based geographical factorization method for point of interest recommendation \
  PDF:  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xutao_Li2/publication/278031194_Rank-GeoFM_A_Ranking_based_Geographical_Factorization_Method_for_Point_of_Interest_Recommendation/links/55d2c94e08ae0b8f3ef8e812.pdf \
  code: http://spatialkeyword.sce.ntu.edu.sg/eval-vldb17/code/RankGeoFM.zip \
  data: is the same as 1.
  
  Points of my interest: The novelty of Rank-GeoFM lies in its definition of loss function. It considers the incompatibility between rankings and estimated scores of POIs. It worth mentioned that among all 12 models, Rank-GeoFM performs almost always the best in various metrics, according to Liu et al..
